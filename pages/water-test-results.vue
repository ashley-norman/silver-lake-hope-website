        SLPOA has the lake treated for weed control and the water tested weekly
        to ensure its suitability for swimming and it regularly tests “squeaky
        clean”.

      Site location: 11 Lakeview Ave, Blairstown NJ 07825 This sample conforms
      to State Public Recreational Bathing Standards for the above analyses.
      Conforms (Yes.No): Designates whether results conform to State Standards
      for public recreational bathing water quality. - pH results in standard
      units. pH shall be 7.2 to 7.8, ideally 7.4 to 7.6. When pH is reported as
      6.8 the pH is 6.8 or below. When pH is reported as 8.2 the pH is 8.2 or
      above. Method - phenol red. - Chlorine or bromine results in parts per
      million, ppm. Free Chlorine shall be 1.0 to 10.0 in swimming pools & 2.0
      to 10.0 in whirlpools, hot tubs or spas. Bromine shall be 2.0 to 10.0 in
      swimming pools & whirlpools, hot tubs or spas. Method - DPD test kit. -
      Heterotrophic Plate Count results in organisms per ml. HPC shall not
      exceed 200 organisms per ml. - Total coliform in swimming pools,
      <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in whirlpools, hot tubs or spas,
      <i>E. coli </i> in beaches, enterococcus in marine waters. Results in
      organisms per 100 ml. Total coliform and
      <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I> results shall be less than 1 organism per
      100ml. <i>E. coli</i> results shall not exceed 320 organisms per 100 ml.
      Entercoccus results shall not exceed 104 organisms per 100 ml. Methods:
      HPC - SM 9215B, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i> - Pseudalert, E. Coli -
      Colilert 18-04 MPN, entercoccus - USEPA 1600, total coliform - If there is
      an exceedance the local health authority should be contacted for
      information on corrective measures, resampling and closures.
